# 8086-AES-Keygen
Project Overview :

The project is a program that generates cipher keys using the AES algorithm in assembly language for the Intel 8086 processor. The program takes user input in plaintext and encrypts it using the AES algorithm to generate a ciphertext. The algorithm uses a block cipher to encrypt data in fixed-size blocks of 128 bits. The key generation process involves setting up a key schedule and encrypting data in each block using a series of operations, including substitution, permutation, and XOR.

Technical Details:

The program will be implemented in assembly language for the Intel 8086 processor. The algorithm will be optimized for performance and memory usage on the 8086 processor. The program will follow the following key steps:

   - Input Validation: The program will validate user input to ensure it is in the correct format and meets any necessary requirements for the encryption process.

   - Key Schedule Generation: The key schedule will be generated from the original cipher key using a series of operations, including substitution, permutation, and XOR.

   - Block Encryption: The data in each block will be encrypted using the key schedule generated in step 2. The encryption process will involve a series of substitutions, permutations, and XOR operations that transform the plaintext into ciphertext.

   - Repeat Encryption: The encryption process will be repeated for each block of data until all blocks have been encrypted, resulting in a complete ciphertext.

   - Ciphertext Output:The program will output the generated ciphertext to the user or store it in memory or a file, depending on the application of the project.
